## Description

This is just a standard weather app that takes a 5 digit US zip code and retrieves the corresponding data upon user request. Users are then presented with the current forecast for the location and also given the option for a 5 day extended forecast.  It was built using React on the frontend and uses an Express.js server on the backend for completing the API requests. 

## Technology/Tools Used

- React
- JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Heroku

## API

- [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)

## Inspiration 

The main reason I decided to build this project was to simply practice working with React. I understood the fundamentals of React when I started this, but by the end, I had learned so much more than any tutorial would have taught me. Every day I was getting stuck on a new problem and just figured it out as I went. The progress was somewhat addicting and before I knew it I found myself waking up each day excited to get on my computer and solve the next issue. This was definetely my favorite project to build so far. 

## URL

The app is currently hosted on a Heroku server and will take some time to load but should not take more than a minute to start up.
